# My Quiz

## Description
In this project I was tasked on creating my own quiz. This project utilized various different ideas and skills that I have learned so far in the bootcamp. This was the hardest challenge for me so far, especially getting everything to work correctly. Being able to combine all 3 elements in the HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make one product is very hard but interesting. Breaking everything down into simple jobs and functions really helped me understand a lot more of the coding, although it is still not the best.
